# HTTP Stuffs with C.
You dont need to actually know C to use this repos. I have tried my best to comment at each step so you understand what is going on in the code. 

Always jump down at the end of file and see main() first and follow the function flow, it will make it easiear for you to understand what is going on.

## HTTP CLIENT
If you ever have used any other language to get webpage using some predefined methods/functions or libraries and have you ever wondered what might actually happen in background of these functions?

Well it may not be same as what happens in those functions you have used but might help to give you an simple idea of what might be happening behind the scene when you try to get a response from a server.

Move onto `httpclient.c` and have a look there.

## I want to run this codes and see myself?
Well in that case download the `httpclient.c` file.
And then you will need gcc to compile the downloaded file.

To compile the file use command:

>gcc -0 httpclient httpclient.c

Now that you have finished compiling you can simply run the output file using command:

>./httpclient

#### ........ WELL I AM LAZY I DONT WANT TO DO ABOVE STEPS THEN wHAT SHOULD I DO?

in that case let me just provide you compiled file too. You can directly run it by using command:

> ./httpclient
